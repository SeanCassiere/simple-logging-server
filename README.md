# Simple Logging Server

This is a dead simple log server that allows you to log messages to a persisted database.

## Development

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file and add the necessary `secrets` into it. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference.
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev`. If you haven't run an init on your database, run `npm run db:push`.

## Usage

### Creating a service

To make any logs into the database, you'll need a valid service account which is active. These account should be regulated by yourself, and should not generated by the public.

You can use the `npm run db:explorer` to view the database, and create a service.

### Creating a log

To create a log, a POST request must be sent to the following endpoint `/api/logs`. The payload for this request should be a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "serviceId": "cl78rvjks0129utq8575twt0g",
  "action": "access-token-requested",
  "environment": "production",
  "ip": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

| Field       | Type                                    | Description                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| serviceId   | String (CUID)                           | The service id of the service that is logging the message. |
| action      | String                                  | The action that is being logged.                           |
| environment | String <br /> **_default_**: production | The environment that the action is being logged in.        |
| ip          | String?                                 | The ip address of the client that is logging the message.  |
| data        | Json?                                   | Any additional metadata to be stored along with this log.  |

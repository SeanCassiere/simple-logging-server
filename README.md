# Simple Logging Server

https://github.com/scalar/scalar/tree/main/packages/hono-api-reference

This is a dead simple log server that allows you to log messages to a persisted database.

## Development

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file and add the necessary `secrets` into it. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference.
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev`. If you haven't run an init on your database, run `npm run db:push`.

## Usage

OpenAPI 3 specification with Swagger explorer is available at `/docs`.

### Creating a service

To make any logs into the database, you'll need a valid service account which is active. These account should be regulated by yourself, and should not generated by the public.

You can use the `npm run db:explorer` to view the database, and create a service.

### Endpoints

Documentation for the available endpoints are OpenAPI 3 compliant. You can view the full documentation at `/docs`.
